; A boggle board is a square NxN matrix of characters
; As a matrix, the first element is the rows, the second is the column M[R][C]
; A word consists of a non-repetitive string of adjacent characters
; By non-repetitive, we mean that a cell cannot be re-used within a single word
; Words have a minimum length of three

; naÃ¯ve strategy
; cycle over wordlist; for each word, try to construct it in the board
; if word is found in the board, add it to the success list
